QB: American Football Android Game

QB is an android project that I have spent a lot of time on, but I just don't have the time to invest in this project. I am open sourcing this project in hopes that the community will contribute to it. 

In it's early stages the game starts with predefined player positions and basically just a single main activity. One tap hikes the ball, players move, and a second tap throws the ball to the tapped location.

This project works properly in Android 4.0.3 and it uses the AndEngine library.

I was hoping to develop a way to parse XML files that define plays. Such as which player moves to where. This way a play creator could also be created allowing the player to create their own plays, and dynamically add them to the game.
